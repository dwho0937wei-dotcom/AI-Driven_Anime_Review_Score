## My Anime Capstone

**Daniel Ho**

### Executive summary

#### Research Question
Can we accurately predict if the upcoming anime will become popular or not based on its
genres, ranking, and other features? What are the factors that can make audiences value or like
a particular anime even more?

#### Rationale
Correctly predicting which anime will be popular will help guide resource allocation for
marketing, production, and distribution because studios can mainly focus their time and effort on
anime predicted to be popular.
Anime predicted to be popular can then, business-wise, be taken advantage of by opening up
more collaboration opportunities. By collaborating with merchandise manufacturers, gaming
companies, and/or streaming platforms, studios and other related businesses can greatly
capitalize on this anime because of its supposedly large audience.
Also, anime predicted to be popular can be potential subjects to plan early for content creating
more seasons of these anime. If a lot of people like these supposedly popular anime so much,
then why not create more seasons based on them so that people can enjoy watching more of
these anime?
